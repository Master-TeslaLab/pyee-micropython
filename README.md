[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyee/badge/?version=latest)](https://pyee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

pyee supplies a `EventEmitter` object that is similar to the
`EventEmitter` class from Node.js. It also supplies a number of subclasses
with added support for async and threaded programming in python, such as
async/await.
